# Alphabets

## Character-encoding schemes

- Interpretation function maps bit sequences to characters
- Function is a typically a bijective mapping table
- Example schemes:
    - ASCII (American Standard Code for Information Interchange)
    - Unicode (ISO 10646)
    - Latin 1 (ISO 8859-1)
- ASCII Example
    - Uppercase letter **A** 
    - Decimal number **65** 
    - Binary **01000001** 

## First 128 symbols in ASCII

## Unicode Basic Multilingual Plane (BMP)

<div class="notes">
In the Unicode standard, a plane is a continuous group of 65,536 code points. There are 17 planes, identified by the numbers 0 to 16 decimal. The 17 planes can accommodate 1,114,112 code points, of which 2,048 are surrogates, 66 are non-characters, and 137,468 are reserved for private use, leaving 974,530 for public assignment.

# Grammars

## Formal languages

Exploration on the board. Learning questions:

- What is a terminal ?
- What is a non-terminal ?
- What constitutes a grammar ?
- What is meant by production rule ?

## Avram Noam Chomsky
Father of modern linguistics (Professor emeritus MIT)

## Chomsky Hierarchy 101 

Type | Name | Additional restrictions
--- | --- | -----------------------------------------------------
0 | Phrase structure grammar | No restrictions on form of production rules
1 | Context-sensitive grammar | Left-hand side shorter than right-hand side for all production rules
2 | Context-free grammar | Left-hand side of production rule is only a variable (non-terminal)
3 | Regular grammar | Right-hand side of production rule is either a terminal or a terminal plus a variable


## Computational complexity


**Membership problem:** 

Given a set of data over $\Sigma$ does it belong to $L(G)$ ?

Type | Membership problem decidable | Complexity
--- | --- | ---
0 | No | Undecidable
1 | Yes | exponential complexity (NP-hard)
2 | Yes | $O(n^3)$
3 | Yes | $O(n)$ (linear complexity)


## Recursion

- Production Rules can be recursive
- Recursion happens when variables appear (indirectly) on left and right-hand side of a production rule
- Often used in practice
- Example: Create a grammar for palindromes

# EBNF

## John Backus (1924 - 2007)

![John Backus](http://amturing.acm.org/images/lg_aw/0703524.jpg)

**Turing Award (1977)**  

*For profound, influential, and lasting contributions to the design of practical high-level programming systems, notably through his work on FORTRAN, and for seminal publication of formal procedures for the specification of programming languages.*

## Peter Naur (1928 - 2016)

![Peter Naur](http://amturing.acm.org/images/lg_aw/1024454.jpg)

**Turing Award (2005)**

*For fundamental contributions to programming language design and the definition of Algol 60, to compiler design, and to the art and practice of computer programming.*

## EBNF - Extended Backus-Naur Form

**Meta syntax** (Meta language) for definition of context free grammars

- Definitions are inline of production rules
    - Terminal symbols (Alphabet) 
    - Non-Terminal symbols (Variables) 
- Standard: ISO/IEC 14977:1996(E) 
- Extended by Niklaus Wirth (ETH) to create a formal definition of the computer language Pascal 

## EBNF Example

```
twelve = "1", "2";
non-zero-number = "1" | "2" | "3" | "4" | "5" | "6" | "7" | "8" | "9" ; 
digit = "0" | non-zero-number ; 
natural-number = non-zero-number, { Digit } ; 
integer = "0" | [ "-" ], natural-number ; 
```
## EBNF symbols

Usage	| Notation
--- | ---
definition	| =
concatenation |	,
termination	| ;
alternation	| \|
optional	| [ ... ]
repetition |	{ ... }
grouping	| ( ... )
terminal string |	" ... " or ' ... '

# Parsers

## Parser

A **parser** is a computer program that 

- performs lexical and syntactic analysis 
- analyses whether data conforms to a formal grammar
- creates an object representation of the data that can be used within programs
- provides meaningful error messages and reporting
- is mostly generated from a grammar via generators
- is always part of compilers and interpreters that translate computer programs into executable binary code

## JEG.js

[Parser generator written in JavaScript](http://pegjs.org/online)

- Creates a parser program based on a grammar
- Metasyntax goes beyond EBNF
    - Embeds code fragments into production rules
    - Binds non-terminals in grammar to variables in code 
    - Embedded code executed while processing data
- Generated parser is itself a JavaScript program 
    - typically downloaded and embedded into own JavaScript programs (and Websites)
    - executed by the browser (or in other JS environments)
    
## JEG.js example and exercise
    
- Example: [Simple grammar for basic arithmetics](http://pegjs.org/online)
- Exercise: Change the grammar to allow division with remainder (modulo) using **%** notation
